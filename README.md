EcoShield: Crop and Rainfall Data Analysis
Project Overview
EcoShield is a data analysis project aimed at studying the relationship between rainfall and the production of three major crops: wheat, maize, and rice. The project uses Python and popular data science libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and numpy to analyze the data and generate insightful visualizations.

Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EcoShield.git
Navigate into the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd EcoShield
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare the dataset: Ensure the dataset (crops and rainfall data) is available in the data/ folder. You can replace the existing file with your own data as long as it follows a similar structure.

Run the analysis: You can either run the Jupyter Notebook located in notebooks/data_analysis.ipynb or execute the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python src/analysis.py
Explore the results: Visualizations and analysis will be displayed or saved, showing the relationships between wheat, maize, rice, and rainfall.

Data Sources
The dataset used contains information about:

Crops: Wheat, maize, rice production in different regions.
Rainfall: Yearly/seasonal rainfall data.
Ensure that the data is well-structured and cleaned before performing analysis.

Results and Insights
This project highlights:

The correlation between rainfall and crop yields.
Trends and patterns in agricultural data over time.
Possible predictive insights for optimizing crop production based on rainfall data.
