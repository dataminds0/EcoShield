# EcoShield:
## Crop and Rainfall Data Analysis
Project Overview
EcoShield is a data analysis project aimed at studying the relationship between rainfall and the production of three major crops: wheat, maize, and rice. The project uses Python and popular data science libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and numpy to analyze the data and generate insightful visualizations.

## Technologies Used
Python 3.x: The programming language used for analysis.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical computations.

Matplotlib: For data visualization.


## The dataset used contains information about:

Crops: Wheat, maize, rice production in different regions.
Rainfall: Yearly/seasonal rainfall data.
Ensure that the data is well-structured and cleaned before performing analysis.

Results and Insights
This project highlights:

The correlation between rainfall and crop yields.
Trends and patterns in agricultural data over time.
Possible predictive insights for optimizing crop production based on rainfall data.
